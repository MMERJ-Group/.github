# Hi there 👋
## Welcome to the MMERJ (Makhtar, Michael, Enosh, Robel, Jesus) Organization

Our current project involves a mobile cooking, recipe creation, and recipe sharing application we're calling Comida. The project is still in the planning stage now but we'll soon have progress. Hopefully...

I'll keep you guys updates on our progress though!
