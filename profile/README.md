# 👋 Welcome to the MMERJ Group Organization
## ❓ What is MMERJ
MMERJ (pronounced "merge") is an organization created by 5 students at the University of Louisville to organize and collaborate on programming and coding projects. The name MMERJ comes from our initials.

## 📏 What is MMERJ Doing
Our current project codenamed "comida" is an intuitive recipe creation and sharing application. In a sense taking inspiration from Pinterest's home page to introduce users to new and creative ways to cook. Currently the project is still under planning but hopefully will have demo versions soon.

No far-off goals yet of how the project should play out. If you have any ideas for the project submit an issue.
